## One Hour Photo Shoot - $360 – 25 final images

Most shoots take about an hour. We're not sticklers about going over a little bit. A group portrait or an artistic shoot is likely to fall into this category. Some themed shoots end up being multiple hours.

Rates may vary depending on the location.

## Mini Shoot – $150 – 15 final images

Headshots or perhaps a very small group portrait generally fall into this category.

### Steps involved

During the shoot I record dozens of photographs. Evaluating the shots, I select the strongest ones and process them to bring out visual strengths and remove any photographic blemishes.

During this process I may address you, the client, with questions as we refine the defined goal.
