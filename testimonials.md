<blockquote>"I had the most incredible photoshoot day with Ric and my photos came out amazing!

I would 100% recommend him as a photographer for any of your personal, family or event needs he has decades of experience as a photographer, working big events & festivals down to small parties, family and 1-1 sessions üòâüôèüì∏

This photoshoot embodied all of my archetypes in such a beautiful way it brought me a lot of joy not only modeling this entire photoshoot, but also seeing the incredible vision on the other side of the camera. The photos, the colors, the natural captured moments. It's awesome, he worked so hard for this vision. He literally carried bags, a wheel barrel full, and a ladder to make these shots be what they are!

So thankful for you and these lovely photos, truly!

Blessings and Love, Surya Chandra"
