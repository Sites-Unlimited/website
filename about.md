# About

As a Southern Illinois University Arts Major turned Florida native, I fell in love with the breath taking landscapes, how the sky meets the water, and ultimately the hearts of the people who drew me here.

Over decades of coordinating events in the Pensacola and surrounding areas, photographing artists and musicians of all mediums became a passion.

In recent years, it has evolved into a profession, documenting a variety of family portraiture, nature scenery, school portraits, themed photo shoots, maternity, boudoir, events, and creativity beyond!

I truly “In-joy" being able to witness Light shine through all subjects, clients, and experiences: artistic, biographical and utilitarian.

Living intentionally and loving boundlessly enable me to recognize the authentic essence of every moment.

Reflecting these moments back into the lens of every individual client, they witness the realm of their own interpreted embodiment.

Memories imprinted forever in the hearts of those who seek to reminisce all things beautiful through the light of the lens, love shining through equally.

My ultimate goal is to collaborate with others, bringing the client’s vision to life, allowing depths of detail to emerge. Simplicity of the photograph reflects the complexities of each moment, intertwining the love that clients share for themselves and others, enriching all that is "brought to light" in the lens through which we see.

I am honored, pleased, and excited to be considered to capture the Sites of your Life for you to Treasure throughout time!
